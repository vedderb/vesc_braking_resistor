*****************************************************************************

*** Next ***
- EXT: Updated lwIP to version 2.1.2.
- HAL: Added support for timers 9..17, 20..22 to STM32 PWM driver.
- HAL: Added support for timers 9..17, 20..22 to STM32 ICU driver.
- HAL: Added support for timers 10 and 13 to STM32 GPT driver.
- HAL: Added support for timers 9..14 to STM32 ST driver.
- HAL: STM32 ST driver is now integrated with new IRQ infrastructure and
       performs cross-checks with GPT, ICU and PWM drivers on timers usage.
- HAL: Improved support for shared handlers. Now there are centralized
       inclusion modules (.inc) containing shared handlers. The new modules
       can be included by the various STM32 platforms. So far the new system
       has been implemented for STM32G0, STM32G4, STM32L0, STM32L4, STM32L4+,
       STM32F7, STM3277. It shall be gradually introduced for all the others.
- HAL: Idle callback support for STM32 USARTv1 UART driver.
- LIB: Added support for asynchronous jobs queues to OSLIB.
- LIB: Added support for delegate threads to OSLIB.
- NIL: Improvements to messages, new functions chMsgWaitS(),
       chMsgWaitTimeoutS(), chMsgWaitTimeout().  
- RT:  Improvements to messages, new functions chMsgWaitS(),
       chMsgWaitTimeoutS(), chMsgWaitTimeout(), chMsgPollS(),
       chMsgPoll().
- HAL: TRNG support added to STM32F7xx, STM32G0xx, STM32G4xx,
       STM32H7xx and STM32L0xx.
- NEW: Added support for .cc files extensions in makefiles.
- HAL: New RTCv3 driver for STM32G0xx and STM32G4xx.
- HAL: Added support for DAC3 and DAC4 in STM32 DACv1 driver.
- NIL: New functions: chSemResetWithMessageI() and chSemResetWithMessage().
- RT:  New functions: chSemResetWithMessageI() and chSemResetWithMessage().
- HAL: Added canTryAbortX() function to CAN driver, implemented
       for STM32 CANv1.
- HAL: Added error handling to WSPI driver, now LLDs can report error
       conditions to upper layers.
- NEW: Added mcuconf.h generator for STM32G4x1, STM32G4x3 and STM32G4x4.
- HAL: STM32 DMAv1 driver improvements and generalization, added support
       for 8 channels.
- HAL: Initial STM32G4xx support in HAL.
- HAL: Added script to generate board files from command line, just
       run ./os/hal/boards/genboard.sh with the board directory name
       as parameter.
- HAL: Modified the ST driver to support, optionally, multiple additional
       callback-capable channels.
- RT:  Removed regarm_t type from port layer and replaced with uint32_t, this
       avoids a lot of casts in the code.
- NIL: Removed regarm_t type from port layer and replaced with uint32_t, this
       avoids a lot of casts in the code.
- NEW: ARM SandBox subsystem added.
- LIB: Added a cache class to OSLIB.
- NEW: Added an option to change the shell thread name.
- HAL: Made bus acquire/release functions in SNOR driver public.
- NEW: Added mcuconf.h generator for STM32L052/L053/L062/L063.
- NEW: Added mcuconf.h generator for STM32L072/L073.
- HAL: Initial STM32G0xx support in HAL.
- HAL: Added STM32L452 support in HAL.
- HAL: Implemented TIMPRE setting for STM32F7xx HAL.
- NEW: Merged FatFS 0.13c.
- NEW: Added a "library generator" project for RT, it allows to
       generate a library with a pre-configured RT. It also includes
       an "header generator" able to generate an unified "ch.h" with
       all options resolved.
- LIB: Improved OSLIB initialization.
- NEW: Lots of style fixes thanks to the new tool.
- NEW: Code style checker tool added.
- NEW: Added and embedded flash driver model in HAL. Added an implementation
       for STM32F1xx, STM32L4xx, STM32L4xx+. 
- HAL: Modified AES GCM function signatures.
- HAL: Added H753 to all H7 mcuconf.h files.
- HAL: Added transactional updates to MFS. Doubled data headers magic numbers
       for improved safety and to keep the final write aligned to 64 bits, it
       is required for STM32 ECC flash.
- VAR: Modified syscalls.c to allocate memory from bottom upward, ChibiOS
       allocators take memory from top downward. This way the memory taken
       using _sbrk_r() does not contain "holes" caused by other allocators.
- LIB: Re-introduced missing chGuardedPoolGetCounterI() function to guarded
       pools allocator.
- LIB: Modified core allocator to be able to get blocks starting from bottom
       or top of the available memory range.
       Removed alignment enforcement for requested block size. Alignment is
       only ensured on the returned pointer, this should reduce memory usage
       is some cases.
